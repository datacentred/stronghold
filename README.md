# Stronghold

The DataCentred dashboard application, formerly at my.datacentred.io

## NOTICE: No longer maintained

Sadly, DataCentred went out of business on 31st October 2017 and all assets were put up for sale. We did not receive bids for our intellectual property, so I have taken ownership of this part of our former codebase.

I no longer work for a public cloud provider, and so am unlikely to maintain it. As a result, this code is now available free of charge under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/seanhandley/stronghold/blob/master/LICENSE) to anyone who wants to use it for their own purposes.
