Hi there,

We've terminated your account for you, as you requested. This means:

- You (and any other users on this account) will no longer be able to access DataCentred apps, the cloud dashboard, or the API.
- Your remaining account balance will be collected in a final bill payable at the end of the calendar month.

If you want to tell us more about why you've closed your account, we'd love to hear from you. Get in touch via issues@datacentred.co.uk.

Kind regards,
The DataCentred Team
